# Lesson 0: Introduction
Hi! Welcome to the HACS repository of web development knowledge (**HACSROWDK**, if you will). Inside the **HACSROWDK** you'll find instructions for different projects that will take you through a range of different web development skills, from beginner to advanced.

### So how does this work?

This project is hosted on a website called Github! If you're not familiar with it, Github is a website that people use to host/store their code and projects. Users create what are called *repositories*, and all the code for a specific project would go inside of one repository. This curriculum is hosted on Github in a repository called `"hacs-opensource-learning"`.

Inside of the repository, there can be both files and folders. If you look in the main directory for the repository, you can see a list of folders, each one containing a different project.

Each folder contains the following:

- A demonstration of what you'll be building
- A list of technologies you'll use to build it
- Instructions on how to build it
- Finished code to reference if you get stuck along the way

### Do I need to download/install anything?

It depends! For beginner-intermediate projects, we will be writing code in an online editor called [CodePen](https://codepen.io). CodePen is a super useful online tool for creating websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and that's what we'll use for the first few levels of projects. 

If you haven't ever used an online program to write code, don't worry! Just create a free CodePen account for now, and follow the instructions in the [first project](https://github.com/chrisnunes57/hacs-opensource-learning/tree/master/Beginner:%20First%20Project) to see how to get started.

### What order should I do the projects in?

You can really do them in any order you want if you're feeling crazy, but here is my recommended sequence (based on difficulty):

1. [First Project](https://github.com/chrisnunes57/hacs-opensource-learning/tree/master/Beginner:%20First%20Project)
2. [All About Me](https://github.com/chrisnunes57/hacs-opensource-learning/tree/master/Beginner:%20All%20About%20Me)
3. [Recipe](https://github.com/chrisnunes57/hacs-opensource-learning/tree/master/Beginner:%20Recipe)
4. [Rainbow Blocks](https://github.com/chrisnunes57/hacs-opensource-learning/tree/master/Beginner:%20Rainbow%20Blocks)
5. [Sun and Moon](https://github.com/chrisnunes57/hacs-opensource-learning/tree/master/Beginner:%20Sun%20and%20Moon)



### What happens if I get lost/stuck?

If you get stuck on a problem, or run into some weird bug that doesn't make any sense (this does happen), feel free to email/message/dm Chris Nunes in the HACS slack, Facebook, or on any platform, really. 

You can also feel free to skip around projects if you don't enjoy one or if you get stuck!



### I really want to learn ____, but there's no project on here!

If there's something that you want to learn about and you can't find good resources online, feel free again to email/message/dm Chris Nunes in the HACS slack, Facebook, or on any platform, really. We'll get it added ASAP.
