# Lesson 0: Introduction
Hi! Welcome to the HACS repository of web development knowledge (**HACSROWDK**, if you will). Inside the **HACSROWDK** you'll find instructions for different projects that will take you through a range of different web development skills, from beginner to advanced.

### So how does this work?

This project is hosted on a website called Github! If you're not familiar with it, Github is a website that people use to host/store their code and projects. Users create what are called *repositories*, and all the code for a specific project would go inside of one repository. This curriculum is hosted on Github in a repository called `"hacs-opensource-learning"`.

Inside of the repository, there can be both files and folders. If you look in the main directory for the repository, you can see a list of folders, each one containing a different project.

Each folder contains the following:

- A demonstration of what you'll be building
- A list of technologies you'll use to build it
- Instructions on how to build it
- Finished code to reference if you get stuck along the way

### Do I need to download/install anything?

It depends! For beginner-intermediate projects, we will be writing code in an online editor called [CodePen](https://codepen.io). CodePen is a super useful online tool for creating websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and that's what we'll use for the first few levels of projects. 

If you haven't ever used an online program to write code, don't worry! Just create a free CodePen account for now, and follow the instructions in the [first project](/tree/master/Beginner: First Project) to see how to get started.

### What order should I do the projects in?

You can really do them in any order you want if you're feeling crazy, but here is my recommended sequence (based on difficulty):
