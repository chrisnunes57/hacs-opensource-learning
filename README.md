# Lesson 0: Introduction
Hi! Welcome to the HACS repository of web development knowledge (**HACSROWDK**, if you will). Inside the **HACSROWDK** you'll find instructions for different projects that will take you through a range of different web development skills, from beginner to advanced.

### So how does this work?

This project is hosted on a website called Github! If you're not familiar with it, Github is a website that people use to host/store their code and projects. Users create what are called *repositories*, and all the code for a specific project would go inside of one repository. This curriculum is hosted on Github in a repository called `"hacs-opensource-learning"`.

Inside of the repository, there can be both files and folders. If you look in the main directory for the repository, you can see a list of folders, each one containing a different project.

Each folder contains the following:

- A demonstration of what you'll be building
- A list of technologies you'll use to build it
- Instructions on how to build it
- Finished code to reference if you get stuck along the way
