# First Project

### Technologies Used

- HTML

Hey! If you're here, you're probably ready to get started on the first project (if not, why?!?). The first thing we'll need to do is create an account on [CodePen](https://codepen.io). 

### Getting started on CodePen

Once you have created your account at [codepen.io](https://codepen.io), we want to create a new "pen". Each basic project that you create on CodePen is called a "pen", so we will be creating a new pen for each of these lessons. You can do this from the CodePen homepage by clicking the "Pen" button in the top right.
